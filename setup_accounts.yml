# this playbook gets run once and only once for each new server.
# it assumes the server has one user account with root privileges

# Purpose: Set Up Accounts for the server
#  1. Log into the target server using the SSH password (not public key)
#  2. Create a 'deploy' user, set up a SSH public key, make sudo'able
#  3. Disallow password login for all accounts
#  4. Disallow root ssh access

# The following seems to be bogus in the original, and can be ignored here:
## only changes made to server: (1) gave static ip address (2) install openssh-server 
## if getting ssh errors during re-build using diff host with same ip address:
## ssh-keygen -f "/home/cisco/.ssh/known_hosts" -R 192.168.1.53
## if you use the dhcp ip to push the first few playbooks, don't forget to create add a new host file 

# Provenance: Original version came from:

# referred from http://jedelman.com/home/server-bootstrap-prep-with-ansible/
# Seasoned with info from Ryan Eschinger's first-time setup
